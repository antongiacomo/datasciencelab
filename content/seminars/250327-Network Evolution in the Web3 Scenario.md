### Abstract

This talk explores the importance of understanding network evolution within the Web3 context, marked by decentralization.
I will first provide an overview of network evolution, highlighting its relevance across various domains and summarizing key findings from existing literature on both network dynamics and Web3 studies. Next, I will introduce the Graph Evolution Rules (GER) approach, detailing its application to the Web3 scenario and presenting insights gained from this analysis.
By examining the evolution of decentralized networks, this talk aims to explore the complexities of network evolution in the Web3 landscape, fostering a deeper understanding of this emerging paradigm.
