### Abstract

Recent advancements in Generative AI are accelerating the development of autonomous AI agents capable of performing complex tasks with minimal human intervention. Yet, as these agents grow in capability, new challenges arise around interoperability, coordination, and the safe integration of AI-driven behaviours into real-world systems. This talk explores how, using no-code design, it is possible to bridge the gap between powerful AI models and practical autonomous workflows, enabling teams to design, control, and monitor agentic systems without requiring deep engineering expertise.

We will examine emerging interoperability standards—such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols—that are shaping a new ecosystem where autonomous agents can reliably collaborate, exchange context, and coordinate actions. Beyond theory, the session will demonstrate a concrete application of these technologies through an autonomous agentic system, showcasing how no-code orchestration empowers secure, scalable, and transparent AI-driven operations.
